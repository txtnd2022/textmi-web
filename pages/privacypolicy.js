      <h2>Information We Collect and How We Collect It </h2>

        understand, customize, support, and market our Services, including when you
        install, access, or use our Services. </p>

      <p>The types of information we receive and collect depend on how you use our
        Services. We require certain information to deliver our Services and without this
        we will not be able to provide our Services to you. For example, you must provide
        your mobile phone number to create an account to use our Services. </p>

      <p>Our Services have optional features which, if used by you, require us to collect
        additional information to provide such features. You will be notified of such a
        collection, as appropriate. If you choose not to provide the information needed to
        use a feature, you will be unable to use the feature. For example, you cannot
        share your location with your contacts if you do not permit us to collect your
        location data from your device. Permissions can be managed through your
        Settings menu on Android devices. </p>

      <p>We must record user information such as the user&apos;s phone number, country of
        origin, username, profile picture. This information is important for us to validate
        your profile as a real profile for security and authenticity reasons</p>


      <h2>Information Access and Why We Need It </h2>

      <p>
        ● To use our services, you must provide us with access to your personal
        contact list to periodically check for your device contacts that have
        registered on Textmi, so you can communicate with them directly or
        through a group on Textmi.
      </p>

      <p>● To use our services, you must provide us with access to your device files
        and its information to allow you to send multimedia and files of different
        formats to your contacts, groups or on your status on Textmi. We do not
        collect any other &apos;files information&apos; other than the information shared by
        you which is stored in an encrypted form in our servers for a limited time
        after which it will only be available locally on your devices.
      </p>

      <p>● To use our services, you must provide us with access to your device
        microphone to allow you to record and send voice messages through chats
        whenever you want. </p>

        camera to let you use your device camera when video calling other users
        on Textmi. </p>

      <h2>Information You Provide to Us</h2>
      <p>● Your Account Information. You must provide your mobile phone number
        and basic information (including a profile name of your choice) to create a
        Textmi account. If you don&apos;t provide us with this information, you will not
        be able to create an account to use our Services. You can add other
        information to your account, such as a profile picture and &qout;about&quot;
        information. </p>

      <p>● Your Messages. We do not retain your messages in the ordinary course of
        providing our Services to you. Instead, your messages are stored on your
        device and not typically stored on our servers. Once your messages are
        delivered, they are deleted from our servers. The following scenarios
        describe circumstances where we may store your messages in the course
        of delivering them:
        <div className='padded'>
          <br />
          ○ Undelivered Messages. If a message cannot be delivered
          immediately (for example, if the recipient is offline), we keep it in
          encrypted form on our servers for up to 30 days as we try to deliver
          it. If a message is still undelivered after 30 days, we delete it.
          <br />
          ○ Media Forwarding. When a user forwards media within a message,
          we store that media temporarily in encrypted form on our servers to
          aid in more efficient delivery of additional forwards.
          We offer end-to-end encryption for our Services. End-to-end
          encryption means that your messages are encrypted to protect
          against us and third parties from reading them.

        manage this information for you in a way that ensures those contacts

        broadcast lists, and such groups and lists get associated with your
