            <h3>Governing Law</h3>
            <p>The validity, construction and enforceability of the Terms of Use and Privacy
                Policy shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of India.</p>

            <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p>Either you or we may refer any dispute for final resolution by arbitration under the

            <h3>Special Arbitration Provision For United States Or Canada Users</h3>
            <p>
                Please read this section carefully because it contains additional provisions applicable
                only to our United States and Canada users. If you are a whatsapp user located in the
                United States or Canada, you and we agree to submit all disputes to binding individual
                arbitration, except for those that involve intellectual property disputes and except those
                that can be brought in small claims court. This means you waive your right to have such
                disputes resolved in court by a judge or jury. Finally, you may bring a claim only on your
                own behalf, and not on behalf of any official or other person, or class of people. You
                waive your right to participate in, or have your dispute heard and resolved as, a class
                action, a class arbitration, or a representative action.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;Excluded Dispute&quot; means any Dispute relating to the enforcement or infringement of
                your or our intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, domains, logos,
                trade dress, trade secrets, and patents) or efforts to interfere with our Services or
                engage with our Services in unauthorised ways (for example, automated ways). For
                clarity and notwithstanding the foregoing, those Disputes relating to, arising out of, or in
                any way in connection with your rights of privacy and publicity are not Excluded
                Disputes.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Federal Arbitration Act.</strong> The United States Federal Arbitration Act governs the
                interpretation and enforcement of this &quot;Special Arbitration Provision For United States
                Or Canada Users&quot; section, including any question whether a Dispute between Textmi
                and you is subject to arbitration. </p>

            <p><strong>Agreement To Arbitrate For Textmi Users Located In The United States Or Canada.</strong> For
                Textmi users who live in the United States or Canada, Textmi and you each agree to
                waive the right to a trial by judge or jury for all Disputes, except for the Excluded
                Disputes. Textmi and you agree that all Disputes (except for the Excluded Disputes),
                including those relating to, arising out of, or in any way in connection with your rights of
                privacy and publicity, will be resolved through final and binding arbitration. Textmi and
                you agree not to combine a Dispute that is subject to arbitration under our Terms with a
                Dispute that is not eligible for arbitration under our Terms.
